# Why We Create

"What's *the point* to make that?" is a question I hear often.

Sometimes the point is just to make something. Creating something is not just an act - it's the simplest way to start a dialogue with the universe. A way of reaching out and touching the hearts and mins of people you may never meet. Every expressed brought to life has the potential to ripple across time and space, connecting with people in ways we can never fully anticipate. Creation not only has the power to touch the hearts and minds of everyone alive, but everyone who comes after us. 

But the act of creation is also an act of self-respect. By creating, you affirm your own worth. You declare that your thoughts, your vision, and your unique perspective matter. You're saying that you are worthy of contributing, of making your mark, of being heard. Every solution you design, every problem you solve, every creation you bring to life is a testament to your potential, your creativity, and your fundamental human ability to make a difference.

So create without fear. Create with passion. Create knowing that your work — no matter how small it might seem — has the power to touch, to heal, to inspire, and to transform. Your creation is a gift to the world and to yourself.
